# quizapp

A new Flutter project.

Description of the app:

A quiz app shows a start screen that welcomes the user with a button to start the quiz. You will go through multiple questions and at the end you will be directed to a result screen. All your answers will be seen in a color different from the color of the correct answers along with a circle that indicates the number of the question with the color red or green to tell whether it is correct or false.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
